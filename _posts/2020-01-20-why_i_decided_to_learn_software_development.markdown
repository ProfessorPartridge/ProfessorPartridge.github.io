I decided to learn software development for several reasons. Primarily, it amazed me at a young age with the power and possibilities of it, the blend of logic and creativity that goes into making a piece of great software, and the nearly unlimited potential that software has and how it can improve people's lives. 

Since I was a kid, I was surrounded by technology. My dad was in IT and was always working on a computer. Most nights I saw him tinkering with his desktop's hardware, working on our network, or playing a video game. He taught me how a computer works, what a program was and how networks operated. Seeing how technology functioned and what went into our computers left an impression on me on how powerful these machines were and the possibilities that they could be used for. More specifically, as a kid, I loved video games and the software that made these fun programs run. Video games, mixed with the knowledge my dad had given me, made me passionate about software and how it can be used.

In addition, software development very clearly involves not only understanding of logic and engineering principles but creativity and even artistic expression itself. To me, software is the perfect blend of left brain and right brain thinking. In order to build great software, you must solve puzzles that solve a problem. You have to engineer a solution to complex problems using order, structure, and logic. But, being human beings, we take these files of code and make powerful and beautiful statements with these same code files. Many video games exist that create entire worlds full of rich lore and landscapes. There are also so many examples of digital media and graphics that also contain beauty and creatvity to make. It goes beyond just solving a simple problem and becomes a new medium for expression. I love the intersection of logic and creativity that software development cultivates. 

Finally, it's easy to see the huge impact that software has on our world. From mapping software that keeps people from getting lost, to messaging apps that let most anyone communicate with others across the world, software chages how we as a society function. I strongly believe we are just scratching the service in terms of what we are able to create with these code files and computers and I very much want to be a part of it. 

There is one last point I wanted to make to answer the question of why I'm choosing to pursue software development. Learning to write code, and increment over and over to build larger applications makes me feel like I'm perfecting an idea. There is a certain craftsmanship to software development that I'm drawn to. I can't help but always be fascinated by the iterative improvement that a software product can have. You continue on until you're left with a well-written, well-documented, efficient set of files that do something to help a human being. 

That's just cool.
